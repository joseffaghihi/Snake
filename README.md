# Snakes and snake forests enumeration: Exhaustive searches and GAN predictions

## Before use
- Install all requirements from `requirements.txt`
- Build `setup.py` to compile cython files

## Enumeration
- Snake enumeration can be done with `serpent_exhaustif.py` or `adjacency_graph_search_exporter.py`
- Snake forests enumeration is done with `adjacency_graph_search_exporter.py`

## GAN training and prediction
- GAN can be launched with `run-gan.py`
- GAN settings and mode (train/predict) can be ajusted in `gan/gan.py`
